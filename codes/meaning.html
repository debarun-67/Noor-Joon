I often wonder why the moon shines,
or why the monsoon rains with sorrow.
The valleys may seem beautiful by name,
but in this world, only you are the true poet of beauty.
The restless wind searches for perfection,
but when you are not found, how can any
     other beauty be compared?
When, in the dark night, someone speaks of grace,
even among the stars, your radiance
     will remain unmatched.
I asked the monsoon why it rains in grief,
it replied, "I will only cease when she becomes mine."
When nature itself grows jealous of your beauty,
even fate begins to rebel.
I asked the moon, "Why do you seem sorrowful?"
It replied, "For even my glow dims before her purity."
You are the desire of the universe,
but it is I who hold your love.
By some incredible twist of fate,
I was graced with your love.
In your delightful company,
each moment feels fragrant and magical.
Your mere presence alone
reveals the breathtaking views of paradise.
Not much time has passed since we met,
yet my heart binds to you as if we were destined.
This is just the beginning of our story,
and its end will only be when life itself ends.
Even in the next life, I will find you,
and our story will continue from where we left off.
But that is a matter for another time,
for now, we must fulfill our love in this life.
We may meet again in another life,
but here too, we must walk as one.
I will always cherish those moments‚Äî
the countless conversations we shared,
those nights when we talked until sleep took over,
each feeling in those moments was unique.
The first time I touched your delicate hands,
it felt as though I held an angel in my palms.
That day when our lips met for the first time,
how do I even begin to describe the magic of that moment?
I write this tale to tell you,
to express what lies in my heart.
I tell you these things time and time again,
yet it never feels like enough,
as if words are too small
to express my love for you.
Now, I must erase every trace of your sorrow,
pull away all your pain, and fill your life with light.
With you by my side,
we will overcome everything together.
Every challenge, every hardship,
we will conquer with ease.
I never imagined I could love someone this much,
never thought a stranger would become my life.
But now, all I want is you, only you,
in every lifetime, in every moment, just you.
Oh beloved, I love you beyond measure,
and in my sacred devotion to love,
all I ask for is your hand in mine‚Ä¶

I LOVE YOU !!!
